# Determining the Radiation Sensitivity Status of Cancer Patients

### [Determining Radiation Sensitivity Status of Patients](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jared-Luxton/Radiation-sensitivity-therapy-patients/blob/master/RADIATION-SENSITIVITY-telos-chromosomes.ipynb)

Extensive, exploratory data analysis in Python of my individual telomere length measurements / chromosome rearrangements for my prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.

Huge work in progress. Lot of experimental graphing, i.e graphing by telomeres by quartile, graphing ~300,000 individual telomere measurements at once.. simple linear regressions in progress
