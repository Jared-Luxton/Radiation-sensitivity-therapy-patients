### [Determining Radiation Sensitivity of Patients](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jared-Luxton/Radiation-sensitivity-therapy-patients/blob/master/RADIATION-SENSITIVITY-telos-chromosomes.ipynb)

Extensive explorative data analysis of my telomere length data, acquired by telomere FISH, in Python. 

Huge work in progress. Lot of experimental graphing, i.e graphing by telomeres by quartile, graphing ~300,000 individual telomere measurements at once.. regressions in progress
